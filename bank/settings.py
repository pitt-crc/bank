"""The ``settings`` module defines default settings for the parent application.
It also provides access to any settings that have been overwritten using
environmental variables in the working environment.

Usage Example
-------------

The ``Defaults`` class provides access to default application settings.
Values for each setting are accessible via attributes. For example:

.. doctest:: python

   >>> from bank.settings import Defaults
   >>>
   >>> # The datetime format used when displaying or parsing dates
   >>> print(Defaults.date_format)
   %m/%d/%y

The ``Settings`` class is similar to the ``Defaults`` class, but
allows for default settings to be overwritten via environmental variables.
The ``Settings`` class should be used instead of ``Defaults`` in
most cases.

.. doctest:: python

   >>> import os
   >>> from bank.settings import Settings
   >>>
   >>> # Specify the date format as an environmental variable
   >>> os.environ['BANK_DATE_FORMAT'] = '%m-%d-%y'
   >>>
   >>> settings = Settings()
   >>> print(settings.date_format)
   %m-%d-%y
