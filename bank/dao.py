"""The ``dao`` module acts as the primary data access layer for the parent
application and defines the bulk of the account management logic.

Usage Example
-------------

The ``Account`` class is used to administrate existing user accounts
with established proposals. For example:

.. code-block:: python

  >>> from bank.dao import Account
  >>>
  >>> # Lock the user account from running any more jobs
  >>> account = Account('account_name')
  >>> account.set_locked_state(lock_state=True)

The ``Bank`` class is used to create new accounts/proposals/investments and
to handle bank wide tasks that aren't specific to a single user. For example:

.. code-block:: python

  >>> from bank.dao import Account
  >>>
  >>> # List all unlocked accounts
  >>> unlocked_accounts = Bank().find_unlocked()
